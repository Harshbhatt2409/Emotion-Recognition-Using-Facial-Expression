# Emotion-Recognition-Using-Facial-Expression
In this project we will be using facial expressions to recognize Human Emotions. We will be using Google Colab for training the dataset and then use VS Code for real time recognition. I have used combination of two different dataset, i.e. FER2013 and AffectNet Sample Dataset
I have used CNN method as it is best when working with photos and videos.
