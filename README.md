# Emotion-Recognition-Using-Facial-Expression
In this project we will be using facial expressions to recognize Human Emotions. We will be using Google Colab for training the dataset and then use VS Code for real time recognition. I have used combination of two different dataset, i.e. FER2013 and AffectNet Sample Dataset
I have used CNN method as it is best when working with photos and videos.

Start by EMOREC file and train your model using the dataset. Then save your h5 and json files to local environment and then open the EMOREC1 file in local environment along with the saved h5 and json files to get real time results.
